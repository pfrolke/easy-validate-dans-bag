SYNOPSIS \u00b6 easy-validate-dans-bag [--aip] [--bag-store <uri>] [--response-format,-f json|text] <bag> easy-validate-dans-bag run-service DESCRIPTION \u00b6 Determines whether a DANS bag is valid according to the DANS BagIt Profile v0 or v1. If the bag does not specify what version of the profile it claims to comply with, v0 is assumed. This module has both a command line and an HTTP interface. The command line interface is documented in the ARGUMENTS section below. The HTTP interface is documented in the Swagger UI . ARGUMENTS \u00b6 Options: --aip Validate as AIP (instead of as SIP) --bag-store <arg> The bag store to use for deep validation -f, --response-format <arg> Format for the result report (default = text) -h, --help Show help message -v, --version Show version of this program trailing arguments: bag (not required) The bag to validate Subcommand: run-service - Starts EASY Validate Dans Bag as a daemon that services HTTP requests -h, --help Show help message --- INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-validate-dans-bag and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-validate-dans-bag . To install the module on systems that do not support RPM, you can copy and unarchive the tarball to the target host. You will have to take care of placing the files in the correct locations for your system yourself. For instructions on building the tarball, see next section. BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-validate-dans-bag.git cd easy-validate-dans-bag mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install . Alternatively, to build the tarball execute: mvn clean install assembly:single","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#manual","text":"Determines whether a DANS bag is valid according to the DANS BagIt Profile.","title":"MANUAL"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"easy-validate-dans-bag [--aip] [--bag-store <uri>] [--response-format,-f json|text] <bag> easy-validate-dans-bag run-service","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"Determines whether a DANS bag is valid according to the DANS BagIt Profile v0 or v1.
